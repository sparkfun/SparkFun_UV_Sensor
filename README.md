Need to apply some sunscreen? SPF 15? SPF 50? SPF 5000? It's time to consult the Qwiic VEML6075 UV sensor!

The **VEML6075** can detect the intensity of UVA (~365nm) and UVB (~330nm) waves. With a quick calculation, those values can be used to generate a standardized **UV index** -- a value from 0 to 11+ which indicates the relative strength of UV irradiance. Seeing a UVI above 6-7? Find some shade, or slather on that sun screen!

The VEML6075 features a simple I<sup>2</sup>C interface, so we stuck it on a [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic)-compatible board. This board requires no voltage translation, no figuring out which pin is SDA or SCL; just plug it in and go!

Check out our [SparkFun_VEML6075_Arduino_Library repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_VEML6075_Arduino_Library) for a simple Arduino library -- there's example code to configure the sensor, read its UVA and UVB outputs, and generate a UV index output. Stay safe out there this summer!

SparkFun labored with love to create this code. Feel like supporting open source hardware?
